pull request. If the change isn't trivial, it may be best to wait for
feedback.

## Coding guidelines

This project targets Python 3.6 or later.

### Docstrings

The docstring lines should not be longer than 76 characters (which allows rendering without soft-wrap of the entire module in a 80x24 terminal window).  
Docstrings should be written in Google format.
