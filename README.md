*A simple module to render colorful Multiple Sequence Alignment with `rich` in the terminal.*

## üí° Example

Use Biopython to load a MSA from an aligned FASTA file, and render it to the
terminal:

```python
import Bio.AlignIO
from rich_msa import RichAlignment

msa = Bio.AlignIO.read("tests/data/swissprot-halorhodopsin.muscle.afa" "fasta")
viewer = RichAlignment(
    names=[record.id for record in msa],
    sequences=[str(record.seq) for record in msa],
)

panel = rich.panel.Panel(viewer, title="swissprot-halorhodopsin.muscle.afa")
rich.print(panel)
```

You should get an output similar to the following picture, scaled to your
terminal width:
